    "### Overview\n",
    "This project is about targetted marketing, in the data set given we have 'customer' as each row of data, and the features can tell us about the customer's status in general (age, marriage, etc..) and hes shopping behavior.\n",
    "In this section of the project I will go over the data set and the goal to try and understand the whole process before starting the actual work on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what exactly is targetted marketing?\n",
    "Targeting in marketing is a strategy that breaks a large market into smaller segments to concentrate on a specific group of customers within that audience. It defines a segment of customers based on their unique characteristics and focuses solely on serving them.\n",
    "Instead of trying to reach an entire market, a brand uses target marketing to put their energy into connecting with a specific, defined group within that market.\n",
    "So for this reason I'll break down all the features in the given dataset ('customers3.csv'), and understand them.\n",

    "- ID - Unique ID to each customer\n",
    "- Gender - The gender of the customer\n",
    "- Ever_Marries - Indicates if the customer was married\n",
    "- Age - The age of the customer\n",
    "- Graduated - Has the customer graduated high school\n",
    "- Profession - The profession of the customer\n",
    "- Work_Experience - The number of years of the customer's expirence in his profession\n",
    "- Spending_Score - The spending habits of the customer classified to 3 categories\n",
    "- Family_Size - The number of family members the customer has in his household\n",
    "- Shop_Day - The day of the week which the customer is shopping on the most\n",
    "- Shop_Other - Normalized measure of customer deviation from average store customer spending on non specified products\n",
    "- Shop_Dairy - Normalized measure of customer deviation from average store customer spending on dairy products\n",
    "- Shop_Household: Normalized measure of customer deviation from average store customer spending on household products\n",
    "- Shop_Meat - Normalized measure of customer deviation from average store customer spending on meat products\n",
